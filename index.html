              <p>
                High-speed data converters require a lot of board space such as traces 
                and vias for the interconnections. These exacerterbated board traces and
                vias can effect funtional performance of the converters, can be the cause 
                electromagnetic interference signals that can challenge the performance
                of the rest of the electronics in the system. For these reason it is 
                best to select JESD204B compliant converters. The JESD204B serial 
                interface resolve the above mention issues, however, at the cost of 
                a complicated implementation. In this project I go through the process
                of designing a high speed analog frond end that is JESD204B compliant.

                During highschool and my bachlor I have always played around with websites or dashboards. 
                I enjoy programming so I decided to take a comprehensive course on web development. The app

                design thoery and practice. I have done this course togheter with freeCodeCademy to really 
                re-enforce the subjects taught in the full stack web development course.

                This course consist of understanding how the linux kernel works and how to leverage it for embedded application. 
                Understanding the device tree and how to use it to write drivers to connect to the linux kernel.

                is responsible for what between the client and the EMC testing lab. Good EMC design and which requirements
                are needed for the PCB or electronic systems were also part of this course.

                The pre-master is a bridging year for applied science bachlor student. The pre-master consist of mathmatical 
                re-enforcement of calculus, linear algebra, statistics and complex analysis. Furthermore, physics and other 
                engineering disciplines are also given such as signals and system, control system, signal processing and 
                communications.

              <p>
                This bachlor consisted of analog and digital design, with embedded programming. Hardware and software
                interface projects were done to re-enforce this. Here, systematic design of electronics and smart
                -sensor and high-speed digital design techniques such as EMC were a core subjects of this eduaction.
                During this bachlor I specialized in a datascience minor. Where data analytics, and engineering were
                the core subjects of the minor. These subject were re-enforced with capstone projets from Kaggle 
                and with data from real business in the region of Amsterdam.

                Soldering PCBs and designing and implementing electrical system from AutoCad blueprint design to cable 
                management and implementation. PLC programming to control street lights and other manufacturing process

              I enjoy doing physics and math. I believe physics explain the beauty of the world and the universe, 
              while math expresses the beauty of the mind. I find it a pity to go through life not knowing these things. 
              Other interest inlcude reading about different topics such as politcal science, economics, physcology and math puzzels. 
              Like puzzels I enjoy solving real-time puzzles such as submission grappeling and brazilian jiu-jitsu. It is 
              awesome, try solving a puzzel that is dynamic and trying to choke you. It involves physics, techniques,
              staying cool under pressure and creativity. I do jiu-jitsu together with weightlifting the chokes and cleans combo. 
              Crossfit is another activity I enjoy doing, still a novice at it though. Nevertheless I enjoy the grind.
